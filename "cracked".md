### "cracked" minecraft

**don't you fucking dare come to us saying you use tlauncher. </br>
we won't help you. at all. delete that shit.**

1. download Prism Launcher - "`PrismLauncher-Windows-MSVC-Setup-VersionNumber.exe`" </br>
2. install prism launcher and then run the following in a command prompt: </br>
`echo {"accounts": [{"entitlement": {"canPlayMinecraft": true,"ownsMinecraft": true},"type": "Offline"}],"formatVersion": 3} > %appdata%/PrismLauncher/accounts.json`
3. profit.

there's also "[sklauncher](https://skmedix.pl/downloads)" - but we've never tried it or used it. </br>
use it at your own risk.
